# 100 Days of Code - Python (Udemy)

This repository contains my learning journey through the Udemy course **100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp**. The course takes me from beginner to mastery in Python, covering:

- Core Python fundamentals
- Web development (Flask/Django)
- Data Science and visualization
- GUI programming (Tkinter)
- Web scraping and automation

## Course Structure

The course is divided into 100 days:

- Each day teaches a new concept.
- Every few days, I build a small project combining learned concepts.
- By the end, multiple real-world projects are completed.

## Repository Layout

- `main.py` → contains course brief and helper scripts to generate daily templates.
- `days/` → will hold folders for each day (e.g., `day_001`, `day_002`, etc.).
- `projects/` → optional folder for major projects.

## How to Use

- Run `python main.py` to print the course brief.
- Run `python main.py --init` to generate folder templates for 100 days.
- Run `python main.py --readme` to regenerate this README.

## Goal

To complete all 100 days consistently while building hands-on projects and gaining a strong understanding of Python and its ecosystem.
